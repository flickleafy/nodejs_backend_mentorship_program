# Node.js Backend Mentorship Program

Welcome to the **Node.js Backend Mentorship Program**! This repository is designed to help students and junior developers systematically evolve their backend skills from beginner to senior levels through hands-on, build-style exercises and real-world scenarios.

## Purpose

This program provides a structured, progressive learning path for Node.js backend development. It covers foundational concepts, practical CRUD operations, database persistence, authentication, file handling, integrations, observability, deployment, and more. Each module contains step-by-step rubrics, acceptance criteria, and recommended best practices, making it ideal for self-study, bootcamps, or guided mentorship.

## Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders:

- **junior_level/**: Foundational to intermediate backend skills, with 8 modules:
  1. **Foundations & HTTP**: Learn the basics of Node.js servers, HTTP, and Express.
  2. **In-Memory CRUD & Pagination**: Build CRUD APIs and pagination logic using in-memory stores.
  3. **Persistence (SQLite/PostgreSQL, Knex/Sequelize)**: Transition to real databases and ORMs.
  4. **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement secure user registration, login, and access control.
  5. **Files, Validation, Documentation**: Handle file uploads, data validation, and API documentation.
  6. **Integrations, Jobs, Caching**: Work with third-party APIs, background jobs, and caching strategies.
  7. **Observability, Testing, Tooling**: Add logging, metrics, tracing, and automated testing.
  8. **Deployment, Security, Performance**: Containerize apps, orchestrate with Docker Compose, and harden security.

- **mid_level/**: Reserved for more advanced backend topics and exercises (to be expanded).
- **senior_level/**: Reserved for senior-level challenges and architectural patterns (to be expanded).

## How to Use

1. **Start at the beginning**: Begin with the first module in `junior_level/1_foundations_http`. Each module builds on the previous.
2. **Follow the rubrics**: Each module's `readme.md` provides clear steps and acceptance criteria.
3. **Progress at your own pace**: Move to the next module once you meet the acceptance criteria.
4. **Experiment and extend**: Try alternative libraries, add features, or refactor for best practices.

## Who Is This For?

- Students and self-learners seeking a practical Node.js backend roadmap.
- Bootcamp participants and instructors.
- Junior developers aiming to reach mid/senior proficiency.
- Mentors looking for a structured curriculum.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository.
- Pick a module in `junior_level/` and read its `readme.md`.
- Complete the exercises, test your solutions, and seek feedback.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit improvements, new modules, or advanced exercises for mid/senior levels.
